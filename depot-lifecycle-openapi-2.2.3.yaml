  title: Depot Life Cycle
  description: "# Purpose\n\n A depot centric API for managing the interchange activity\
    \ & repair lifecycle of a shipping container.  The API is expected to be used\
    \ by Customers, Depots, and Owners to facilitate real time communication between\
    \ systems instead of traditional EDI files.\n\n\n\n # Overview\n\n The depot lifecycle\
    \ API is a RESTful API.  It's requests & responses are loosely based upon traditional\
    \ EDI files.  For code defintions, explanations, or traditional EDI definitions\
    \ refer to [IICL TB 002, February 2003](https://www.iicl.org/iiclforms/assets/File/public/bulletins/TB002_EDIS_February_2003.pdf).\
    \  The requests and responses are formatted according to the [JSON](https://www.json.org/)\
    \ standard.\n\n\n\n # Reference\n\n This API is documented by the [OpenAPI](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/versions/3.0.0.md)\
    \ specification.  This page was initially created by the [Swagger-Editor](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-editor)\
    \ tool and later autogenerated via the [sample java application](https://github.com/IICL-API/depot-lifecycle-api/tree/main/samples/java)\
    \ in the GitHub repository.  The *yaml* specification file can be found [here](depot-lifecycle-openapi.yaml).\
    \  \n\n\n\n # Implementation Expectations\n\n Not all parties are required or\
    \ expected to implement every feature. Any feature not implemented should return\
    \ a http status code of `501`.  \n\n\n\n # APIs to Implement\n\n While anyone\
    \ is free to implement all or a selected set of the APIs listed here, the typical\
    \ use case would be for Depot to Lessor communication.  For the Depot, they would\
    \ call the Lessor's system using the following APIs:  \n 1. POST - create a gate\
    \ record \n 2. PUT - update a gate record \n 3. POST - create an estimate revision\
    \ \n 4. PUT - marks a shipping container repaired \n\n These APIs allow the Depot\
    \ to report the initial gate in movement, issue gate data corrections (i.e. the\
    \ damage status or activity date), participate in the estimate process (i.e. creation,\
    \ surveys, and customer approval), notify when a shipping container is repaired,\
    \ and create a gate out for leaving the depot.\n\n\n\n\n # Deprecation\n\n If\
    \ this API version were to be discontinued, a minimum of 6 months time would pass\
    \ before it's removal.\n\n\n\n # Change Log\n\n * 2.2.1\n\n    - Estimate Photo\
    \ support for line items and the overall estimate (header).\n\n * 2.2.2\n\n  \
    \  - Estimate Line Items are optional.\n\n    - Error Responses optionally support\
    \ multiple messages via a details field.\n\n    - Various improvements for BETA\
    \ APIs.\n\n * 2.2.3\n\n    - Party model (optional):\n\n        - Latitude & Longitude\n\
    \n        - Physical Address\n\n        - Contact Phone, Fax, & Phone Number fields\n\
    \n    - Insurance Coverage model:\n\n         - Add indicator for insurance coverage\
    \ applicable to CTL scenarios\n\n    - Release & Redelivery models - Status field\n\
    \n    - Redelivery model - Add field to store estimate recipient emails\n\n  \
    \  - RedeliveryUnit model - Add cargo # to identify type of cargo by UN or other\
    \ standard numbers\n\n    - RedeliveryUnit model - Add technical bulletins field\n\
    \n    - Release search - Add search flag to find candidate units\n\n\n\n\n # Security\
    \ & Authentication\n\n To ensure secure communication, all endpoints of this API\
    \ should use the https protocol instead of http.  Authentication methods will\
    \ differ between systems, but two popular methods are JSON Web Tokens and Static\
    \ Tokens.  Examples for both of these follow.\n\n## JSON Web Token\n\n [JSON Web\
    \ Token, or JWT](https://jwt.io/), is used for stateless authentication.  Since\
    \ all requests are sent using https, tokens are not encrypted.  Tokens follow\
    \ the [RFC 6750 Bearer Token](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6750) format. \n\n\
    ### 1. Example JWT Token\n\n ```\n\n {\n\n \"username\": \"jdoe\",\n\n \"roles\"\
    : [\n\n \"ROLE_GATE_CREATE\",\n\n \"ROLE_GATE_UPDATE\"\n\n ],\n\n \"email\":\"\
    j.doe@example.com\",\n\n \"token_type\":\"Bearer\",\n\n \"access_token\":\"eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9...\"\
    ,\n\n \"expires_in\":3600,        \n\n \"refresh_token\":\"eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9...\"\
    \n\n }\n\n ```\n\n\n\n\n\n An access_token is provided for authentication to API\
    \ endpoints and a refresh_token is provided to generate a new access_token when\
    \ one expires.\n\n\n\n\n\n ### 2. Obtaining an access token\n\n Issuing a POST\
    \ request to `/api/login` with a username and password payload will cause a JWT\
    \ token to be issued in the response.\n\n ```\n\n POST /api/login HTTP/1.1\n\n\
    \ Content-Type: text/plain; charset=utf-8\n\n Host: www.example.com\n\n\n\n\n\n\
    \ {\n\n \"username\": \"jdoe\",\n\n \"password\": \"jdoepassword\"\n\n }\n\n ```\n\
    \n\n\n\n\n ### 3. Refreshing an expired token\n\n Tokens created by invoking the\
    \ login endpoint expire after a determined period.  Issuing a POST request to\
    \ `/oauth/access_token` with: the refresh_token from the JWT token previously\
    \ issued and a grant_type of refresh_token will reissue a new JWT token.\n\n ```\n\
    \n POST /oauth/access_token HTTP/1.1\n\n Host: www.example.com\n\n Content-Type:\
    \ application/x-www-form-urlencoded\n\n\n\n\n\n grant_type=refresh_token&refresh_token=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9...\n\
    \n ```\n\n\n\n\n\n ### 4. Checking if a token is valid\n\n Any token can be checked\
    \ if it's still valid by issuing a POST request to `/api/validate`.\n\n ```\n\n\
    \ GET /api/validate HTTP/1.1\n\n Host: www.example.com\n\n Authorization: Bearer\
    \ eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9...\n\n Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8\n\n\
    \ ```\n\n\n\n\n\n ### 5. Accessing a protected resource\n\n Use the 'Authorization'\
    \ header to supply the JWT for authentication to a protected resource.\n\n ```\n\
    \n GET /api/v2/gate/CONU1234561 HTTP/1.1\n\n Host: www.example.com\n\n Authorization:\
    \ Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9...\n\n ```\n\n## Static Tokens\n\n A static token\
    \ is assigned by an external process or system.  After assignment, any documented\
    \ API endpoint can be invoked by including a header of \"Authorizaton\" and the\
    \ value of the token.  Some systems will assign static tokens that are JWTs, in\
    \ that case \"Bearer \" should prefix the token in the header value.\n\n### Static\
    \ (JWT) Token Example\n\n Assuming an assigned JWT of \"eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9\"\
    , an API gate show request would look like: \n\n```\n\n GET /api/v2/gate/CONU1234561\
    \ HTTP/1.1\n\n Host: www.example.com\n\n Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9\n\
    \n ```\n"
